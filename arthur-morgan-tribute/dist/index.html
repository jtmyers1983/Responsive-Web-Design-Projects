    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>Arthur Morgan was born somewhere in the northern region of the United States in 1863. His exact date and place of birth is unknown. His parents were Beatrice and Lyle Morgan.  Little is known of his early life, other than that his mother died when he was very young.  His father was later arrested for larceny in 1874, when Arthur was only 11 years old. We also know that at some point between 1874 and 1876 Arthur witnessed his father's death.  He was later picked up by outlaw Dutch van der Linde, and Hosea Matthews. He came to view Dutch as a surrogate father and quickly adapted his wild and free lifestyle.</p>
    
    <h3>
      Gaining Outlaw Status
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Arthur became older, he made the decision to fully initiate himself into the Van Der Linde Gang, which consisted of a small group of outlaws and runaways.  Throughout his years he would commit many atrocities, including murder, multiple bank and train robberies, as well as intimidating others into paying debts owed to the gang.  He earned a fierce reputation as both an avid hunter, and a deadly gunslinger.  In fact, it is now believed that the stories of the legendary gunslinger Jim Boy Callaway, were actually the deeds of Arthur Morgan, who was paid hansomly to allow Calloway to take the credit.

    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>Arthur Morgan died in 1899 near the Roanoke Ridge area in the State of New Hanover.  It is believed that he died of Tuberculosis, although this is unconfirmed.</p>
